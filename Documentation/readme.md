COST AND AGE

The Calculator we know today was first invented in the 1960&#39;s. The use of smartphones as a calculator began in the 1990&#39;s.

Several computing machines were made long before the arrival of digital calculators and smartphones. The abacus, for example, was used in the ancient Near East, Europe, Russia, and China long before the adoption of the written Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

The Hewlett-Packard 9100A is an early programming calculator, first appearing in 1968. HP called it a desktop calculator.

The hp-34 was Hewlett-Packard&#39;s first pocket calculator and the world&#39;s first scientific pocket calculator. A calculator with Trigonometric &amp; Exponential functions. It was introduced in 1972

The SR-50 was Texas instruments first scientific pocket calculator with Trigonometric &amp; Logarithmic functions. It was introduced in 1974.

Casio is a major player in the graphing calculator market. It was introduced in 1985. Notable features are its ability to graph functions and that it is programmable.

Table:

**WHY:**

A machine is anything that reduces human effort. We use calculators so that we can find out answers to mathematical problems without using too much of our energy and time and also reducing our effort.

**WHAT:**

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, a normal calculator will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Even our computer is a calculator. There are two types of electronic calculators, the simple one, with only the main functions of plus, minus, times and division, and sometimes a square root, and the scientific one, with many other functions too such as factorials, and cosine functions.

**WHERE:**

The calculator is used everywhere. Basically it can be used in accounts where there will be large mathematical operations.

**WHEN:**

The calculator can be used whenever we want to perform any large arithmetic operation.

**HOW:**

The main objective of the calculator is to perform the different types of operation efficiently without wasting time in this busy world.
