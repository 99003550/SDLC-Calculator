**Design Analysis**

- **Low Level-**

- The speed of the calculator, it should give output within seconds.
- The system functions need to be specified and work properly.
- The precision of the calculator should be more.
- The functions taking take input and process the output within nanoseconds.

**Design Mapping-**
**Low level requirements-**

| **ID** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Symbols like +,-,\*,/ to carry out simple addition, substraction,multiplication and division to operations. |
| 2 | Must accept numbers from 0 to 9. |
| 3 | Calculator must be included with different calculation switching modes. |
