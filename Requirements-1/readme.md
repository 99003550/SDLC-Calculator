COST AND AGE:

The Calculator we know today were first invented in the 1960’s. The use of smart
phones as calculator began in 1990’s.

Several computing machines were made long before the arrival of digital
calculator’s and smart phones. The abacus, for example, was used in the ancient
near East, Europe, Russia, and China long before the adoption of the written
Hindu-Arabic numeric system.

The Hewlett-Packard 9100A is an early programming calculator, first appearing in

    HP called it as a desktop calculator.

The hp-34 was the Hewlett-Packard’s first pocket calculator and the world’s first
scientific pocket calculator. A calculator with Trigonometric & Exponential
functions. It was introduced in 1972

The SR-50 was Texas instruments first scientific pocket calculator with
Trigonometric & Logarithmic functions. It was introduced in 1974.

Casio is a major player in the graphing calculator market. It was introduced in

    Notable features are its ability to graph functions and that it is
    programmable.

DEFINING PRODUCT:

The advanced scientific calculator performs various operations ranging from
calculating the sum, difference, product, division, bitwise or, bitwise and & xor of
two numbers to calculating the factorial, power, square root, sine, cosine, tan,

logarithmic values of a given number. It is equipped with a special feature to
calculate the sum of all numbers till the given input number and also calculate the
factorial of a given number.

WHY:

A machine is anything that reduces human effort. We use calculators so that we can find out answers to mathematical problems without using too much of our energy and time and also reducing our effort.

WHAT:

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, a normal calculator will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Even our computer is a calculator. There are two types of electronic calculators, the simple one, with only the main functions of plus, minus, times and division, and sometimes a square root, and the scientific one, with many other functions too such as factorials, and cosine functions.

WHERE:

The calculator is used everywhere. Basically it can be used in accounts where there will large mathematical operations.

WHEN:

The calculator can be used whenever we want to perform any large arithmetic operation.

HOW:

The main objective of the calculator is to perform the different types of operation efficiently without wasting of time in this busy world.
